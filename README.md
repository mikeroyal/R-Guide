# R Tools, Libraries and Frameworks

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) is an integrated development environment for R and Python, with a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a newer package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R.

[Rmarkdown ](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a package helps you create dynamic analysis documents that combine code, rendered output (such as figures), and prose. 

[Rplugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/Rplugin) is R Language supported plugin for the IntelliJ IDE.

[Plotly](https://plotly-r.com/) is an R package for creating interactive web graphics via the open source JavaScript graphing library [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js).

[Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/) is a Python/R library that helps scientists and engineers build and manage real-life data science projects. Metaflow was originally developed at Netflix to boost productivity of data scientists who work on a wide variety of projects from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning.

[Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet) is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.

[LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/) is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. 

[Dash](https://plotly.com/dash) is a Python framework for building analytical web applications in Python, R, Julia, and Jupyter.

[MLR](https://mlr.mlr-org.com/) is Machine Learning in R.

[ML workspace](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace) is an all-in-one web-based IDE specialized for machine learning and data science. It is simple to deploy and gets you started within minutes to productively built ML solutions on your own machines. ML workspace is the ultimate tool for developers preloaded with a variety of popular data science libraries (Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, and MXnet) and dev tools (Jupyter, VS Code, and Tensorboard) perfectly configured, optimized, and integrated.

[CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/) is a fast, scalable, high performance Gradient Boosting on Decision Trees library, used for ranking, classification, regression and other machine learning tasks for Python, R, Java, C++. Supports computation on CPU and GPU.

[Plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) is a tool that allows you to create a web API by merely decorating your existing R source code with special comments. 

[Drake](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake) is an R-focused pipeline toolkit for reproducibility and high-performance computing.

[DiagrammeR](https://visualizers.co/diagrammer/) is a package you can create, modify, analyze, and visualize network graph diagrams. The output can be incorporated into R Markdown documents, integrated with Shiny web apps, converted to other graph formats, or exported as image files.

[Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) is a general-purpose literate programming engine in R, with lightweight API's designed to give users full control of the output without heavy coding work.

[Broom](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) is a tool that converts statistical analysis objects from R into tidy format.
